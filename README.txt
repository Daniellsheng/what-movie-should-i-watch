This is a weekend project where I created a Flask app that would return a random movie to watch.
The list of possible movies are obtained from https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/ and the http://www.omdbapi.com/ api is used to obtain more information about the movie;
To run this program just do:
<code> pip install requirements </code>
and then run the app with:
<code> python wmsimw.py </code>
which should then be available at localhost:5000
