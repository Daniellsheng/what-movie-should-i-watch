# What Movie Should I Watch

This is a weekend project where I created a Flask app that would return a random movie to watch.
The list of possible movies are obtained from https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/ and the http://www.omdbapi.com/ api is used to obtain more information about the movie.

## Installation



```bash
pip install requirements 
```

## Usage

```python
python wmsimw.py
```

The app should then be available at localhost:5000
